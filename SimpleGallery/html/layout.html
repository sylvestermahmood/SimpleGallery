                                    <p>Movies, also known as films, are a type of visual communication 
                                        which uses moving pictures and sound to tell stories or inform 
                                        (help people to learn). People in every part of the world watch 
                                        movies as a type of entertainment, a way to have fun. For some people,
                                        fun movies can mean movies that make them laugh, while for others it 
                                        can mean movies that make them cry, or feel afraid.

                                        Most movies are made so that they can be shown on big screens at 
                                        movie theatres and at home. After movies are shown on movie screens
                                         for a period of weeks or months, they may be marketed through several
                                          other media. They are shown on pay television or cable television, and 
                                          sold or rented on DVD disks or videocassette tapes, so that people can
                                           watch the movies at home. You can also download or stream movies. 
                                           Older movies are shown on television broadcasting stations.</p>
